/*Task
Implement a function which finds the numbers less than 2, and the indices of numbers greater than 1 in the given sequence, and returns them as a pair of sequences.

Return a nested array or a tuple depending on the language:

The first sequence being only the 1s and 0s from the original sequence.
The second sequence being the indexes of the elements greater than 1 in the original sequence.
Examples
[ 0, 1, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 1, 0 ] => [ [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ], [ 2, 4, 5, 6 ] ]
